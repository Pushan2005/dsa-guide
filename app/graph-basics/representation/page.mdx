# Graph Representations

Graphs can be represented in various ways. Two common representations are the **Adjacency List** and the **Adjacency Matrix**. Below are detailed explanations of both, including diagrams and tables.

Consider the following graph:

## Adjacency List Representation

An adjacency list represents a graph as an array of lists. Each list corresponds to a vertex in the graph and contains all the vertices adjacent to it.

### Adjacency List Table

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th className="px-4">Vertex</th>
            <th className="px-4">Adjacent Vertices</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1, 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0, 2, 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>0, 1, 4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Adjacency Matrix Representation

An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of size VÃ—V where V is the number of vertices. The element at row i and column j is 1 if there is an edge between vertices i and j, and 0 otherwise.

Using the same graph:

### Adjacency Matrix Table

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th className="px-4">Vertex</th>
            <th className="px-4">0</th>
            <th className="px-4">1</th>
            <th className="px-4">2</th>
            <th className="px-4">3</th>
            <th className="px-4">4</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>0</strong>
            </td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>1</strong>
            </td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>2</strong>
            </td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>3</strong>
            </td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>4</strong>
            </td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
