# Depth First Search

<br />
Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible
along each branch before backtracking. It starts at the source node and explores
as deep as possible before backtracking to explore other paths.

## Pseudo Code

```plaintext
DFS(G, u):
    u.visited = true
    for each v ∈ G.Adj[u]:
        if v.visited == false:
            DFS(G, v)

init():
    for each u ∈ G:
        u.visited = false
    for each u ∈ G:
        if u.visited == false:
            DFS(G, u)
```

## Explanation

1.  The algorithm starts by initializing all the vertices in the graph with `visited = false`.
2.  The `init` function is called to explore all the connected components in the graph.
3.  For each vertex `u` in the graph, if it is not visited, the `DFS` function is called to explore the connected component starting from `u`.
4.  The `DFS` function recursively explores all the adjacent vertices of `u` that have not been visited yet.
5.  The `visited` flag is used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.
6.  The algorithm explores the graph in a depth-first manner, visiting nodes as deep as possible before backtracking.

## Example

Consider the following graph:

<Image src={g1} alt="Graph" />

Starting from node `0`, the DFS traversal of the graph is as follows:

-   Visit node `0` and mark it as visited
-   Explore node `1` and mark it as visited
-   Explore node `2` and mark it as visited
-   Explore node `4` and mark it as visited
-   Backtrack to node `2` and explore node `1`
-   Explore node `3` and mark it as visited

## Complexity Analysis

-   Time Complexity: $$O(V + E)$$
-   Space Complexity: $$O(V)$$

Where $$V$$ is the number of vertices and $$E$$ is the number of edges in the graph.
