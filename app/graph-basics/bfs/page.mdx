# Breadth First Search

<br />
Breadth First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that traverses the graph
level by level. It starts at the source node and explores all the nodes at the present
depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

## Pseudo Code

```plaintext
BFS(G, s)
    for each vertex u in G
        u.color = WHITE
        u.d = INFINITY
        u.pi = NIL
    s.color = GRAY
    s.d = 0
    s.pi = NIL
    Q = []
    ENQUEUE(Q, s)
    while Q is not empty
        u = DEQUEUE(Q)
        for each v in G.Adj[u]
            if v.color == WHITE
                v.color = GRAY
                v.d = u.d + 1
                v.pi = u
                ENQUEUE(Q, v)
        u.color = BLACK
```

## Explanation

1.  The algorithm starts by initializing all the vertices in the graph with color
    `WHITE`, distance `INFINITY`, and predecessor `NIL`.
2.  The source node is colored `GRAY`, distance `0`, and predecessor `NIL`.
3.  A queue `Q` is initialized and the source node is enqueued.
4.  The algorithm dequeues a node `u` from the queue and explores all the adjacent
    nodes of `u`.
5.  If an adjacent node `v` is `WHITE`, it is colored `GRAY`, its distance is set to
    `u.d + 1`, and its predecessor is set to `u`.
6.  The node `u` is colored `BLACK` after all its adjacent nodes are explored.

## Example

Consider the following graph:

<Image src={g1} alt="Graph" />

Starting from node `0`, the BFS traversal of the graph is as follows:

-   Visit node `0` and color it `GRAY`
-   Enqueue node `0`
-   Dequeue node `0` and visit its adjacent nodes `1` and `2`
-   Visit node `1` and color it `GRAY`
-   Enqueue node `1`
-   Visit node `2` and color it `GRAY`
-   Enqueue node `2`
-   Dequeue node `1` and visit its adjacent nodes `0`, `2`, and `3`
-   Visit node `3` and color it `GRAY`
-   Enqueue node `3`
-   Dequeue node `2` and visit its adjacent nodes `0` and `1`
-   Dequeue node `3` and visit its adjacent nodes `1`
-   Dequeue node `0` and visit its adjacent nodes `1` and `2`
-   Visit node `4` and color it `GRAY`
-   Enqueue node `4`
-   Dequeue node `1` and visit its adjacent nodes `0`, `2`, and `3`
-   Dequeue node `2` and visit its adjacent nodes `0` and `1`
-   Dequeue node `3` and visit its adjacent nodes `1`
-   Dequeue node `0` and visit its adjacent nodes `1` and `2`
-   Dequeue node `4`
-   The BFS traversal of the graph is complete
