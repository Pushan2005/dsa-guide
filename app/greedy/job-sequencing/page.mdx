# Job Sequencing with Deadlines

Job Sequencing is a problem where we have a set of jobs, each with a deadline and a profit. The goal is to find the maximum profit by scheduling the jobs in such a way that they are completed before their respective deadlines. We assume that each job takes one unit of time to complete.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Job</th>
            <th>Deadline</th>
            <th>Profit</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>J1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>60</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J2</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J3</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>20</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J4</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>40</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J5</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>20</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Pseudo Code

```plaintext
JobSequencing(jobs)
    sort jobs in decreasing order of profit
    maxDeadline = maximum deadline in jobs
    slots = new Array of size maxDeadline
    for i = 0 to maxDeadline
        slots[i] = 0
    for i = 0 to jobs.length
        for j = jobs[i].deadline downto 1
            if slots[j] == 0
                slots[j] = jobs[i].profit
                break
    return slots
```

## Explanation

1. Sort the jobs in decreasing order of profit.
2. Find the maximum deadline in the jobs array.
3. Create an array `slots` of size equal to the maximum deadline. This array will store the profit of the job scheduled at each deadline.
4. Initialize all elements of `slots` to 0 as default.
5. Go through each job in descending order of profit.
6. For each job, find the first available slot before its deadline and schedule the job there.
7. If no slot is available before the deadline, skip the job. (This way, only the most profitable job is scheduled at each deadline.)

## Example

Consider the following set of jobs:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Job</th>
            <th>Deadline</th>
            <th>Profit</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>J1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>60</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J2</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J3</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>20</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J4</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>40</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J5</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>20</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

After sorting the jobs in decreasing order of profit, we get:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Job</th>
            <th>Deadline</th>
            <th>Profit</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>J2</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>60</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J4</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>40</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J3</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>20</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J5</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>20</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Now, we can schedule the jobs as follows:

-   Schedule job J2 at the latest available slot before its deadline (i.e., **slot 1**).
-   Schedule job J1 at the latest available slot before its deadline (i.e., **slot 2**).
-   Schedule job J3 at the latest available slot before its deadline (i.e., **slot 3**).

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Job</th>
            <th>Deadline</th>
            <th>Profit</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>J2</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>60</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>J3</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>20</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The total profit is 180.
