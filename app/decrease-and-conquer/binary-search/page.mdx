# Binary Search

Binary search is a simple way to find an item in a sorted list. It works by splitting the list into two parts.

First, it checks the middle item. If the item you’re looking for is smaller, it focuses on the lower half. If it’s bigger, it looks at the upper half.

This back-and-forth keeps going until it either finds the item or runs out of options.

## Pseudo Code

```plaintext
BinarySearch(A, n, x)
low = 0
high = n - 1
while low <= high
    mid = (low + high) / 2
    if A[mid] == x
        return mid
    else if A[mid] < x
        low = mid + 1
    else
        high = mid - 1
return -1
```

## Explanation

-   `A` is the array you’re searching through.
-   `n` is the number of elements in the array.
-   `x` is the item you’re looking for.

1.  Set `low` to 0 and `high` to `n - 1`. This sets the search boundary.
2.  Select the middle element of the array.
3.  If the middle element is the item you’re looking for, return its index.
4.  If the middle element is smaller than the item you’re looking for, set `low` to `mid + 1`. This sets the search boundary to the upper half of the array.
5.  If the middle element is bigger than the item you’re looking for, set `high` to `mid - 1`. This sets the search boundary to the lower half of the array.
6.  Repeat steps 2-5 until you find the item or run out of options.

## Complexity Analysis

-   Time Complexity: $$O(\log n)$$
-   Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$
-   Best Case: $$O(1)$$
    > The best case occurs when the element you’re looking for is in the middle of the array.
-   Average Case: $$O(\log n)$$
-   Worst Case: $$O(\log n)$$
    > The worst case occurs when the element you’re looking for is at the end of the array.
