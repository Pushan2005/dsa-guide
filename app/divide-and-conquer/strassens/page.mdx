# Strassen's Matrix Multiplication

Strassen's matrix multiplication is a divide and conquer algorithm that multiplies two square matrices.

## Pseudo Code

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$$

$$B = \begin{bmatrix} e & f \\ g & h \end{bmatrix}$$

---

$$p1 = a(f - h)$$

$$p2 = (a + b)h$$

$$p3 = (c + d)e$$

$$p4 = d(g - e)$$

$$p5 = (a + d)(e + h)$$

$$p6 = (b - d)(g + h)$$

$$p7 = (a - c)(e + f)$$

---

$$A \times B = \begin{bmatrix} p5 + p4 - p2 + p6 & p1 + p2 \\ p3 + p4 & p1 + p5 - p3 - p7 \end{bmatrix}$$

> Formula should be given in the exam, so you don't need to remember it.

## Explanation

1. Divide the matrices into four submatrices of size $n/2 \times n/2.$
2. Calculate the seven products recursively.
3. Combine the seven products according to the formula.
4. The final matrix is the product of the two matrices.

## Complexity Analysis

-   Time Complexity: $O(n^2.81)$
-   Space Complexity: $O(n^2)$
-   The naive matrix multiplication algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^3).$
