# Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts the two halves, and then merges the sorted halves.

## Psuedo Code

```plaintext
MergeSort(array)
    if array.length <= 1
        return array
    else
    if array.length > 1
        mid = array.length / 2
        left = MergeSort(array[0...mid])
        right = MergeSort(array[mid...array.length])
        return Merge(left, right)
```

## Explanation

1. The `MergeSort` function takes an array `array` as input.
2. If the length of the array is less than or equal to 1, the array is returned as it is. This is the **base case** for the recursion.
3. If the length of the array is greater than 1, the array is divided into two halves.
4. The `MergeSort` function is called recursively on the left and right halves of the array.
5. The `Merge` function is called to merge the sorted left and right halves.
6. The process continues until all elements are sorted.

## Complexity Analysis

-   Running time complexity: O(n log n)
-   Space complexity: O(n)
-   Best-case time complexity: O(n log n)
    > The best-case occurs when the input array is already sorted.
-   Average-case time complexity: O(n log n)
-   Worst-case time complexity: O(n log n)
    > The worst-case occurs when the input array is sorted in descending order.
