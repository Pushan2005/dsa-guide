# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting method. It builds a sorted list by adding one item at a time. This method works well for small lists or lists that are nearly sorted.

## Pseudo Code

```plaintext
InsertionSort(A)
  for j = 2 to A.length
    key = A[j]
    i = j - 1
    while i > 0 and A[i] > key
      A[i + 1] = A[i]
      i = i - 1
    A[i + 1] = key
```

## Explanation

1. The `InsertionSort` function takes an array `A` as input.
2. The `for` loop iterates over the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the end of the array.
3. The current element is stored in the variable `key`.
4. The variable `i` is set to the index before the current element.
5. The `while` loop moves elements greater than `key` one position to the right.
6. The `key` is inserted into the correct position in the sorted part of the array.
7. The process continues until all elements are sorted.

## Complexity Analysis

-   Running time complexity: O(n^2)
-   Space complexity: O(1)
-   Best-case time complexity: O(n)
    > The best-case time complexity occurs when the input array is already sorted.
-   Average-case time complexity: O(n^2)
-   Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2)
    > The worst-case time complexity occurs when the input array is sorted in reverse order.
