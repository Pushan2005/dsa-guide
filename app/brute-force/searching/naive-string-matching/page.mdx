# Naive String Matching

Naive string matching is a basic way to find patterns in text. It uses a sliding window method. Hereâ€™s how it works: it looks at the pattern and the input string one character at a time. If there's a mismatch, it moves the window over by one character and starts comparing again.

## Pseudo Code

```plaintext
function naive_string_matching(text, pattern):
    n = length of text
    m = length of pattern

    for i from 0 to n - m:
        j = 0
        while j < m:
            j = j + 1
        if text[j + i] != pattern[j]:
            break
        if j == m:
            return i
    return -1
```

## Explanation

1. The function `naive_string_matching` takes two arguments: `text` and `pattern`.
2. It calculates the length of the text and the pattern.
3. It iterates through the text from 0 to `n - m`.
4. For each position `i`, it compares the characters of the text and the pattern.
5. If there's a mismatch, it moves the window over by one character.
6. If it finds a match for the entire pattern, it returns the starting index of the match.
7. If it goes through the entire text without finding a match, it returns `-1`.

## Complexity Analysis

-   Running time of the algorithm: O($(n-m+1) \cdot m$)
-   Space complexity: O(1)
-   Best-case time complexity: O(m)
    > The best case happens when the pattern is found at the beginning of the text.
-   Average-case time complexity: O($n^2$)
-   Worst-case time complexity: O($n^2$)
    > The worst case happens when the pattern is found at the end of the text or when the pattern is not found at all.
