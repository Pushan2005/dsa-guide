# Linear Search

Linear search is an easy way to look for a specific value in a list. It checks each item one by one. It keeps going until it finds what you're looking for or checks every item in the list.

## Pseudo Code

```plaintext
function linear_search(list, target):
    for each item in list:
        if item == target:
            return item
    return null
```

## Explanation

1. The function `linear_search` takes two arguments: `list` and `target`.
2. It iterates through each item in the list.
3. If the item is equal to the target, it returns the item.
4. If the function goes through the entire list and doesn't find the target, it returns `null`.

## Complexity Analysis

-   Running time: O(n)
    > The function has to check every item in the list.
-   Space complexity: O(1)
-   Worst-case time complexity: O(n)
    > The worst-case happens when the target is not in the list, and the function has to check every item.
-   Average-case time complexity: O(n)
-   Best-case time complexity: O(1)
    > The best-case happens when the target is the first item in the list.
